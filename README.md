# District-reopening-data
The data contains weekly update about schools reopening in school districts across the US
After the coronavirus forced a mass closing of K-12 school buildings in the spring of 2020, district leaders had to decide how to provide instruction for 2020-21. From July to September, Education Week tracked the first-day instructional plans for over 900 of the nation’s 13,000 public school districts.
This data provides a snapshot of how districts began the 2020-21 school year. When the project concluded Sept. 21, the dataset included:
- 907 districts
- The 100 largest districts in the U.S., including Puerto Rico
- The largest district in each state
- At least 5 districts from each state (exceptions are Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico)
